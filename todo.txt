readd general part of experiments section into documentation

compute gradient of exact solution, transform back from absolute value
presentation for that, add energy exact error

take a look at  how prolongation code from nando works

let the programs run for a fixed period of time and compare the obtained results
(since CR seems to yield better results but take a much longer time)

start experiment with much 1e-2 or sth not to big, such that there will be more
data points for the convergence graph
