%[ABM] modelization of a large number of problems in physics, mechanics, or image
%processing requires the introducion of new functionals spaces permitting
%discontinuities of the solution. In phase transitions, image segmentation,
%plasticity theory, the study of crasks and fissures, the study of the wake in
%fluid dynamics , and so forth, the solution of the problem presents
%discontinuities along one-odimensionalmanifolds.
%-solution of these problems cannot be found in classical Sobolev spaces
