MATLAB is copyOnWrite, so try not to change structs in functions to avoid the
struct being copied 

for all non-AFEM functions compute all necessary data (in particular
that is dependent on geometry) before and pass it to the functions i.e.
mentality is efficiency >> memory usage

.' is the same as transpose
' is the same as ctranspose, i.e transpose and complex conjugate

reshape uses columns first, than rows, and lastly dimensions

figures that might be included in LaTeX should not have titles or more 
information than, e.g., plot and axis

checkcode to optimize code (new name for mlint) and also mlintrpt

>edit functionname< can be used to read functions (even MATLAB functions)

profiling for performance optimization, this also uses checkcode

computation of right-hand side for linear system in
solvePrimalDualFormulation.m should be done with respect to inner edges but is
done with respect to dof until there is a computation needed where dof and
inner edges are not the same
