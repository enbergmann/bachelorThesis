experiment eps 1e-2 (where L2 error stagnates) - to argue that energy difference of iterates and eps 1e-4 isn't far fetched

compare different epsStop (1e-2, 1e-3, 5e-3, 1e-4, 5e-4, 1e-5) and compare the L2 errors. maybe find out that 1e-3 is enough. try to find largest eps such that error reduction is as good as with smaller eps


think abot some other experiments with exact solution and test some different
epsStop there aswell to reaffirm the results

maybe also reaffirm with uniform refinement
---

don't present l2 squared in tau comparison (unnecessary if l2 is presented)

---

reaffirm tauSize results for uniform refinement, just to make sure
---> reaffirmed, same behaviour observed

Document that benchmark file name can only contain letters and numbers

Put more stuff in current data reduced (like lvl?)
