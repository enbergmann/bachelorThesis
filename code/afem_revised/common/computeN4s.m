function n4s = computeN4s(n4e)
%% computeN4s - Nodes for sides.
%   computeN4s(n4e) returns a matrix in which each row corresponds to one side
%               of the decomposition. The side numbering is the same as in
%               e4s, s4n, s4e, length4s, mp4s, normal4s and tangent4s. Each
%               row consists of the numbers of the end nodes of the
%               corresponding side. n4e is as specified in the
%               documentation.
